<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> cooperate to exploit Chiptopia (Chipotle's new promotion) to earn 3x more free meals.</p>
 
<p>Remember Chipotle's foodborne illnesses in 2015? After their stock dropped 55% and they shored up food safety, the next thing to do was win back customers. Chiptopia is the latest incarnation of free burrito promotions and it's the craziest one yet!</p>

<p>[insert Chiptopia rewards table]</p>

<p>The idea is: every 4 meals you checkout with the Chiptopia rewards card, you get a free meal (which counts towards the next 4!). Even better, if you log at least 4/8/11 visits all three months, you get the Mild/Medium/Hot tier reward. This is great and all, but if you're a normal person who only eats 4-7 Chipotles per month, all you get is <strong>4 free meals</strong>. <em>Instead</em>, if you cooperate with a friend (pooling visits on one card), you'd earn the Hot tier reward of catering for 20, totaling <strong>29 free meals</strong>.</p>

<p>We took this one step further by making a website loaded with Chiptopia cards. If you click <span id="use-barcode">Use a QR code</span>, the website chooses the best card for getting maximum Hot tier rewards. Then click <span class="fake-button">Show the QR code</span> before letting the cashier scan. If the card has accumulated a free meal, feel free to redeem it, but remember to click <span class="fake-button">I got a free meal</span> on the "Use a QR code" page.</p>

<p><form action="{{ url_for('index') }}" method="GET"><input type="submit" value="Get started!" id="go-home" /></form></p>

<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>

<p><strong>What if I accidentally click <span id="use-barcode">Use a QR code</span>?</strong> Return home, click &#9998;, and then <span class="fake-button">I didn't actually use the code</span>.</p>

<p><strong>What if I click <span id="use-barcode">Use a QR code</span> but accidentally close the page but I get to use it?</strong> Return to home and click &#9998; to view that particular visit/QR code.</p>

<p><strong>What if I want to use my own card, or don't use the suggested card?</strong> No problem! Just click &#9997; next the the card you used and manually log your visit.</p>

<p><strong>How do I add my own card?</strong> Click <span class="fake-button">Add a new code</span> and follow the instructions. This will put your card at the end of the queue to be used by others. (Please add the phone number you signed up with, in case the cashier asks for the associated number.)</p>
